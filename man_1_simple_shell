.TH "Simple Shell Project Manual"

.SH NAME
simple shell \- A simple shell implementation

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B Simple Shell

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Simple shell
is a custom implementation of a Unix shell. It allows users to execute commands interactively or process commands from a file in non-interactive mode.
It supports basic shell functionality, including command parsing, environment handling, and executing programs.

.SH COMPILATION
.B Use this command to compile the program : gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh

.SH USAGE
.TP
.B Interactive Mode
Run the shell and type commands one at a time. Each command is executed immediately:
.EXAMPLE
$ ./hsh
$ ls -l
$ pwd
$ exit
.TP
.B Non-Interactive Mode
Provide a script or a list of commands via a file or pipe:
.EXAMPLE
$ echo "ls -l" | ./hsh

.SH OPTIONS
.B simple shell
does not currently accept any options or flags.

.SH BUILT-IN COMMANDS
The following built-in commands are supported:

.TP
.B exit
Exit the shell. Optionally, provide an exit status:
.EXAMPLE
$ exit 0
.TP
.B env
Print the current environment variables:
.EXAMPLE
$ env
.TP
.B cd
Change the current directory (not implemented in this version).

.SH EXTERNAL COMMANDS
If the command is not a built-in, the shell attempts to locate and execute it using the `PATH` environment variable.
Commands can be executed with their absolute path or relative to the current directory:
.EXAMPLE
$ /bin/ls

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.B simple shell
relies on the following environment variables:

.TP
.B PATH
Specifies the search paths for executable files.
If a command is not in the directories specified by `PATH`, it will not be found unless given an absolute path.
.EXAMPLE
$ echo $PATH

.TP
.B HOME
Specifies the home directory for the current user.

.TP
.B SHELL
Identifies the current shell in use. This variable is not actively modified by `hsh`.

.SH EXIT STATUS
.B hsh
returns the following exit codes:

.TP
.B 0
Successful execution or when the `exit` command is used without a status.
.TP
.B 1
General errors, including failure to locate or execute a command.
.TP
.B 126
Command found but not executable.
.TP
.B 127
Command not found.

.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
.B Interactive Mode:
Run the shell interactively to execute commands:
.EXAMPLE
$ ./hsh
$ ls
$ echo "Hello, world!"
$ exit

.TP
.B Non-Interactive Mode:
Execute commands from a file:
.EXAMPLE
$ echo -e "ls -l\npwd\nexit" > script.sh
$ ./hsh script.sh

.TP
.B Piped Commands:
Process commands from a pipe:
.EXAMPLE
$ echo "ls -la" | ./hsh

.SH LIMITATIONS
.B hsh
currently supports basic shell functionalities. Advanced features like piping (`|`), redirection (`>`), and background processes (`&`) are not implemented.

.SH BUGS
